Handwritten Digit Recognition

Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using deep learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits (0-9), and uses a neural network to classify images accurately.

Features

Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification

Trained on the MNIST dataset for high accuracy

Allows users to input custom handwritten digits for prediction

Provides a simple and intuitive interface for testing the model

Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

Model Architecture

Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale image

Convolutional Layers: Extracts features from the image

Pooling Layers: Reduces the spatial dimensions

Fully Connected Layers: Makes predictions based on extracted features

Output Layer: Uses Softmax activation for classification

Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset and performs well in real-world scenarios.

Future Enhancements

Support for additional handwritten datasets

Deployment as a web or mobile application

Integration with real-time image processing
